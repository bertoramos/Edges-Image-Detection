Edge detection:
	
	Edge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying points in a digital image 
	at which the image brightness changes sharply or, more formally, has discontinuities. 
	The points at which image brightness changes sharply are typically organized into a set of 
	curved line segments termed edges.

	Applications:
		Image processing: visualize spots.
		Robotics vision.

	Sobel : The Sobel operator, sometimes called the Sobelâ€“Feldman operator or Sobel filter, 
			is used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection 
			algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges.
